    <h2>Application Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This program is named 'Adventure' and it gives you control of a squad of characters with random names and statistics.  
        You will be able to battle with this squad against another squad.  While I have spent a great deal of time with the
        program it is still not in a complete state.  A GUI is present but much of the game loop is unplayable and only some
        basic concept and functions are useable.  Right now the program creates two squads for you and an opponent.  You are able 
        to attack using only the first members of each squad.  The health and damage for each member of a squad is randomized in 
        a range determined by their class.  You can also heal yourself but only 5 times to limit the health possible.  I started 
        to write my main loop for the program but I unfortunately ran out of time.  One of the final features include the ability 
        for the first memeber of your squad to speak.  The final feature though allows you to view either your or your opponents squad stats.

    <h2>Technology Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The code currently runs of the python programming language.  The program is based off of an old Java program I had created in a 
        high school class.  I use two different modules throughout the code.  These modules are tkinter and random.
