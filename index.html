    <h2>End-User Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Currently this project is not completely finalized.  My overall goal for this project is to 
        update and translate an old high school java program into an improved python program.  This program 
        is named 'Adventure' and it gives you control of a squad of characters with random names and statistics.  
        You will be able to battle with this squad against another squad.  Each of the characters can attack in different 
        ways and all can take random amounts of damage.  Despite this vague overview I hope to take this idea and make it 
        into a solid program that is easy and fun to use.
    </p>

    <h2>Technology Overview</h2>
    <p>
        There is going to be a lot that this program will need.  My main gripe is going to be translating my code into python.  
        While there are some rough java to python translators I am going to try and manually translate much of this code with the 
        help of online resources.  Another big technology problem is going to be reading the java program and finding how to make 
        everything work properly in python.  This is problematic somewhat as it has been a decent while since I wrote java and 
        understood everything.  I hope I can study up quick and make the program the best it can possibly be.
